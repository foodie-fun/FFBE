# BackEND for the FoodieFun Application
This is the backend for foodiefun APP

Pitch: As an avid foodie, I love going out to eat.  I hate remembering what I have and haven’t ordered at each place, what I liked and didn’t like, what the wait time was a certain times of day, etc.  Did I like the burrito or enchilada better? The spicy version or normal?

MVP:

 1. An on-boarding process for a user.
2. Ability to easily create and post a menu item review(restaurant name, restaurant type (italian, mexican, fast food, etc.) menu item name, photo of your order, price, food rating (could use 5 star method or other), other comments, your wait time, date of visit). Hitting submit adds item to the homepage.
 3. Ability to easily edit / delete a review. Deleting removes from homepage.
 4. Homepage to see a grid of all your recent menu item reviews.  Can filter by restaurant, price, food type (mexican, italian, dessert, etc.), date visited and your rating.


Stretch: Add a social aspect. You can friend other users, and see what they order frequently or rate the highest at places new and old.
